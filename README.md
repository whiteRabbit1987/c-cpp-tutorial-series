This repository is a structured, step-by-step tutorial designed to help learn or review C and C++, from beginner fundamentals to advanced concepts.

It covers core language syntax, memory management, pointers, object-oriented programming, modern C++ features, and practical examples, with code organized in a logical progression. Each section builds on the previous one, making it suitable for both newcomers and experienced programmers looking for a refresher.

The goal is clarity, correctness, and hands-on learning—focused on understanding why things work, not just how. Ideal for students, self-learners, and developers who want a solid, well-structured reference for C and C++.
